 Country Information App

This JavaScript application allows users to explore information about countries from around the world. It fetches data from a public API and dynamically generates and displays cards for each country. Users can filter countries by region, search for countries by name, and view detailed information about a selected country.

 Features

- Dark Mode Toggle: You can switch between light and dark mode by clicking the toggle button. In dark mode, the background color changes to a darker theme, improving visibility in low-light environments.

- Filter by Region: Use the region dropdown menu to filter countries by their geographical region. Selecting a region will update the displayed countries accordingly.

- Search by Name: The search input allows you to search for countries by name. The search is case-insensitive and dynamically updates the displayed countries as you type.

-Country Cards: Each country is represented by a card containing key information, including its name, region, capital, and population. Clicking on a card expands it to reveal additional details about the selected country.

-Additional Information: When a card is expanded, you can find extra information about the country, such as its car sign, timezones, sub-region, and continents.
